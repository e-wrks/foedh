# File Operating Đ (Edh)

A bare [Đ (Edh)](https://github.com/e-wrks/edh) interpreter has only
access to the computer's
[main memory](https://gunkies.org/wiki/Main_memory)
, yes, nothing more. So to write
[Shell Scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script)
in Đ (Edh), you'll need a derived interpreter with batteries connected
to the [OS](https://gunkies.org/wiki/Operating_system) resources, thus
this project.

But this repository is by far just a placeholder for the idea above,
if you're actually interested to work on it, search the 
[issues here](https://github.com/e-wrks/foedh/issues) 
and file one before starting your work, to avoid duplicate efforts.

Or just do whatever you want.
